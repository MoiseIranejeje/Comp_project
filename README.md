Space Typist
Master typing offline, conquer the longest word, and rank among the stars!

Space Typist is a Chrome extension built for Hack Club BrowserBuddy. It’s an interactive typing game that works offline, helping you boost your typing speed while you’re stranded in space (or just waiting for Wi-Fi). Type words to repair your ship, level up, and face the ultimate challenge: pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis—the longest word in English! Earn ranks from Beginner to Cosmic Legend based on real-world typing speeds.

Features
Offline Play: No internet? No problem—fully functional anywhere, anytime.
Progressive Levels: Start with short words (Level 1), ramp up to tech terms (Level 3), and tackle the 45-letter monster at Level 4.
Real-Time Stats: Track your Score, WPM (words per minute), Accuracy, Errors, and Streak.
World-Class Ranking: Compare your WPM to pro typists (e.g., 70 WPM = Pro, 150+ = Elite).
Interactive Fun: Progress bar flashes, point pop-ups, and feedback keep you hooked.
Timer Challenge: Start with 15 seconds, gain +2s per word, +10s per level, and 30s for the final word.
